            <p class="note title">Atalaya Upper Mountain Trail</p><p class="note date">Friday, May 21, 2021 at 11:15AM -06:00</p><p class="note content">Me at the trailhead.
 I loved this trail for a couple of reasons; namely, the trailhead was in the middle of a high-end development, and it was funny to see all these fancy homes with an actual mountain just hanging out in their backyard. The hike itself was moderately challenging, and the weather could have been better but we made the most of it.
The rolling mountain range was picturesque for most of our hike, and it didn&rsquo;t take long before all of Santa Fe came into view.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/newmexico2021/">newmexico2021</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/newmexico-2021/newmexico2021-5/">

For ten dollars we were granted the ability to walk the ranch and explore its popular trails. We chose to go see Chimney Rock first, as it was a moderately difficult trail that was said to be quite popular.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/newmexico2021/">newmexico2021</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/newmexico-2021/newmexico2021-4/">

After numerous recommendations from random folks on the internet, we decided that visiting Taos on the High Road was a must-do while here in New Mexico. Basically, there are two routes to Taos - one is more direct, one is more scenic but a little bit longer. You can reference the above map to get an idea for where we went and took each picture.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/newmexico2021/">newmexico2021</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/newmexico-2021/newmexico2021-3/">

Each dish can have infinite variations, infinite possibilities for new flavor pairs and ideas. Often times food is an expression of something else; a deeper (or more shallow) meaning behind each dish brings with it fresh taste and renewed soul. Maybe we sit down to eat some pancakes at the local breakfast favorite; these moist disks of syrup-sponge are now the foundation upon which you will build your day, or perhaps even your entire weekend.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/newmexico2021/">newmexico2021</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/newmexico-2021/newmexico2021-2/">

 Off we go&hellip;
Today was a planned hiking day at one of the highly recommended spots near Santa Fe called the Bandelier National Monument. We entered the canyon at around 12:30 in the afternoon, with beautiful rock formations to the right of the road beyond the trees. After parking, mom stopped by the gift shop in search of a hat which luckily we found right away.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/newmexico2021/">newmexico2021</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/newmexico-2021/newmexico2021-1/">

The only new thing about the airport is that KCI is getting a new terminal, but we were not in that terminal (it is only halfway done) so we just saw it from the outside. The last flight I had been on was about a year and a half ago in December of 2019, but the experience has not changed much except for that masks are a distinct requirement everywhere.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/newmexico2021/">newmexico2021</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/flying/">flying</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/europe-2019/europe2019-3/">

We dragged ourselves downstairs by 10:30am before the breakfast closed at 11. The breakfast was what you would expect from a standard European hotel - lots of cheeses and cold meats, alongside juice and pastries.
We had originally planned for this day to be a quiet day to familiarize ourself with the city, and that is almost exactly what it ended up being.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/europe2019/">europe2019</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/granada/">granada</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/europe-2019/europe2019-2/">

Our flight from Manchester was only a short 2.5 hours, and customs in Granada was a breeze (the customs agent was super cool, he gave me a stamp). Getting off the plane, we were met with the beautiful Granada sun, pictured below in all of its glory:
Our driver was prompt, and spoke little English which was to be expected.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/europe2019/">europe2019</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/granada/">granada</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/europe-2019/europe2019-6/">

In terms of sleepiness, the excitement of meeting everyone overcame that feeling for the first few hours. When we landed, mind you, it was 7:30am so I had a whole day to get through (after having got no sleep on the plane…).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/travel-blog/">Travel Blog</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/europe2019/">europe2019</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/travel/">travel</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/uk/">uk</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/europe-2019/europe2019-4/">
