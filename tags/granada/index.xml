      <title>Granada, España - Day 1</title>
      <link>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/granada-day1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long day the night before, my mom and I weren’t particularly quick to get out of bed. We dragged ourselves downstairs by 10:30am before the breakfast closed at 11. The breakfast was what you would expect from a standard European hotel - lots of cheeses and cold meats, alongside juice and pastries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had originally planned for this day to be a quiet day to familiarize ourself with the city, and that is almost exactly what it ended up being. After talking with the concierge, the decision was made that we would scratch our planned hike for tomorrow seen as it would be awfully expensive to get transportation there and back (roughly 100 Euros). Instead, my mom found this highly-rated night walking tour of Granada through the company Six Thrills. All I will say for now is that we were incredibly pleased with the tour, and you should definitely utilize their services if you are in the area :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the hotel and started to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-1.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Market Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the small, open shops you find in Granada have the same types of inventory as each other. Nonetheless, the tapestries are eye-catching, as my mom found just minutes into the start of our adventure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-2.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Tapestry Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are out onto the main street, you have many options on where to go next - we chose to go left, and walk alongside El Rio de Darro, which is the river that surround the Alhambra. The walk is beautiful, with multiple quaint shops and tapas bars (of course) as you go East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Rio de Darro is not a big river - in fact, I think “moat” better describes it. Nonetheless, it inspires the growth of lots of greenery down this road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitting with the theme of Granada as a whole, cars and buses tend to drive down this small road forcing pedestrians to either side of the road as they pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-3.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Motorcycle Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you continue walking down this main street, it will eventually open up to a larger walking path to the right, and the road widens. Soon enough, you will catch your first glimpse of the Alhambra. It is difficult to see from such a low angle, but it is unmistakable nonetheless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-4.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;First View of Granada&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we found the gates to the Alhambra further up the walkway, we decided to turn around and head back towards the hotel. We made a couple of stops along the way in order to look at the menus of some restaurants. There was also an adorable dog just soaking up the sun, so of course I had to go say hi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-5.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Dog Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I did not at all expect was the beauty of simply walking through the city. You do not really find a contrast of modern/traditional style buildings - everything is just beautiful. This I believe is in part due to the UNESCO heritage protections. Much of Granada is protected for a variety of different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually ventured towards El Centro - the center of the city. This is where you will find many department stores / modern clothing shops. Just before you get to El Centro, there is a small square with a hotel and many roads that converge onto the main street. We found a restaurant that we might try later called Wild Food - it is a Vegan restaurant, so it should be interesting. As it turns out, vegetarian food/tapas are very popular around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-nightime-adventure-tour&#34;&gt;The Nightime Adventure Tour&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I kinda mentioned above, we shifted our plans around and signed up for this “Night Adventure Tour,” which was described on Trip Advisor as a 3 hour walking tour of Granada at night. Sounds good. And the reviews were really good as well, so that is exciting. Before meeting for this tour, we ate dinner at a place called Carmela, near the vegan restaurant I mentioned. It was pretty good, and my mom found a new bottle of vino blanco she likes (I forget the name :o). Anyways, we met at the Sixthrills office and we were off with our tour guide Marija.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour started off on a good note for one main reason - there were only 3 other people on the tour besides us :D Yay! Marija took us up some of the winding streets of Granada towards our first viewpoint. She said that on Friday nights, it is exceedingly common for there to be hoards of hippies coming up to these viewpoints to smoke weed (despite its illegality). That said, there were only a couple of people at the first viewpoint, and they were indeed relaxing as one might say. This first viewpoint was overlooking Granada, but specifically the Alhambra in all of its glory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-6.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Granada Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to climb up the winding streets, and were met with some cops who had busted the aforementioned hippies for smoking weed. Cool. Marija said that the police don’t often bother with marijuana possession, and that was the first time in her three years of residence where she had seen a legal altercation regarding weed. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I kinda talked about earlier, something so incredible about this city is the beauty of the buildings. Everywhere you looks, there is architectural eye candy. Eventually we made it up to the most popular, and most touristy, Alhambra viewpoint. I got my photo, and got out of there quick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-7.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Granada Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marija told us there would be no shortage of Alhambra views, and she was definitely right. Moving on, we continued to venture up towards Sacromonte, which is the region of Granada home to the Gypsies. During this leg of the journey, we passed by many houses known as las carmenas. Each house called “carmen” was built to be self sustaining, with a large walled garden, grape vines growing on top, etc. They were absolutely beautiful. We stopped at a very quiet and peaceful bar for more views of the Alhambra as the sun set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-8.jpg&#34;

        alt=&#34;Granada Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we made our way up to the tallest point in Granada, which is a church at the top of the hill, and I was able to get some final pics before we head back home for the night:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/img/granada-10.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Granada Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that was day one - it was incredible :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Landed in Spain</title>
      <link>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/granada-day0/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 17:18:42 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next step in our European adventure takes place in the lovely city of Granada, Spain. Our flight from Manchester was only a short 2.5 hours, and customs in Granada was a breeze (the customs agent was super cool, he gave me a stamp). Getting off the plane, we were met with the beautiful Granada sun, pictured below in all of its glory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/landedinspain-4.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Market Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our driver was prompt, and spoke little English which was to be expected. It seemed as though he and his wife were traveling together. Once we arrived at one of the principle streets in downtown Granada, we were told that we must continue our journey to the hotel on foot. We tipped the driver, and his wife accompanied us all the way to the entrance of the hotel. This is where we got our first glimpse of the labyrinth of streets that zig-zag all over Granada. As you turn the first corner, the hustle and bustle of the principle street disappears, and you are me with a much quieter, serene walk. The streets are just wide enough to fit a small car, although I would never want to be tasked with driving down them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/landedinspain-1.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Market Photo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/landedinspain-2.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Market Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, we were at the hotel. We checked ourselves in, and decided that we should go out and try some of the famous tapas that we had read so much about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back out to the main road wasn’t difficult, however deciding where to eat was. There are tapas bars everywhere. In order to give us a better idea, I tried to consult Google Maps for some of the best places to get tapas in the area. Los Diamantes was the first place on the list. We looked around, and it was right across the street from where we were standing - yay, food! But we entered the bar and there were no empty tables in sight - sad, no food. In addition to this, the overwhelming stench of seafood put my mom off, so we decided to try someplace else. Next on the list was Los Manueles. We entered, and once again were met with a lack of empty tables (you can see a theme, here…) The waitress we spoke to said 5-10 minutes for a table, but when a table finally opened up the folks behind us in line took it. I guess we needed to be more aggressive… Anyways, with each tapas bar, we slowly learned more about tapas culture, and we decided to leave once again to try one last place before giving up and calling it a night (keep in mind that at this point, it was already 11:00pm and we were tired from a day’s travel). The final tapas bar we tried was Bodegas Castaneda, about a five minute walk from Los Manueles. We finally got a table outside! Yay. A quick look over the menu prompted my mom to order a glass of Sangria and tapas frias to share. I quite enjoyed the variety of meat and cheese on toast, although my mom was not too keen (she did enjoy the pate, though). It was also relatively expensive for the amount of food you got - about 16 Euros for the medium plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/landedinspain-3.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Market Photo&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, for night one, I thought we did alright. After the bill was paid, we were off to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Few Days in the UK</title>
      <link>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/unitedkingdomtime/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arriving in the Manchester International Airport was less stressful than I initially anticipated it to be - we got through customs without even talking to anyone, got our bags within the next 10 minutes, and met up with my Aunt. In terms of sleepiness, the excitement of meeting everyone overcame that feeling for the first few hours. When we landed, mind you, it was 7:30am so I had a whole day to get through (after having got no sleep on the plane…). To help keep moving and stay awake, we took a nice walk around the block. I grabbed my camera, and we were off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://blog.nathandodson.com/ukdays2.jpg&#34;
        alt/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the tail end of our walk, we stopped at the local Latham’s for some sandwiches and sausage rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In the air!</title>
      <link>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/intheair/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 21:14:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/intheair/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So my really well thought out plan to beat the jet lag failed miserably. It was about 9:00pm CST, and I decided that with five hours left in the flight I should just try and go to sleep then and there, Well I got my headphones plugged in and music turned on and sleep mask ready - I was asleep in 10 minutes,,,, Only to wake up 30 minutes later, unable to sleep any longer. The universe decided that tonight was not the night for me, so here I am writing this instead,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some initial observations; I am not the only one it seems who cannot get a good night’s rest on the plane. My neighbors to the left have both surfaced and returned to their devices since I have been awake. In addition to this, the flight attendant has been by twice in the past hour to refill my hot chocolate :D I would fly Virgin Atlantic again in a heartbeat. It also helps that there are only about 15 seats occupied here on the second floor of the plane, which is a huge bonus for being able to sprawl out and (try) to sleep. From what I can tell, my mom is sleeping pretty well right now which is good because she was telling me how difficult it is for her to sleep on planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been getting some alright videos of my journey so far, so I cant wait to take more when we land :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it for me for tonight. Now that it is later I’m gonna try this whole sleeping thing again…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trip Preparation</title>
      <link>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/tripprep/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 11:32:42 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.nathandodson.com/posts/europe-2019/tripprep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my trip to Europe, my preparation has been significantly more intensive than what would be considered “normal” on previous trips I’ve had. This is mainly because I have set a few goals for myself, some small, and some much larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, I want to beat the jet lag - at least on my flight to Manchester. Our current itinerary has us leaving Atlanta at 6:00PM and arriving in Manchester just before 7:00AM. This means that I will need to sleep the entire flight to have energy for the day in Manchester. In order to achieve this, I have started to do a few things: one, I went to bed at around 9:00PM Monday night and woke up at around 3:00AM the next morning (the morning I am writing this :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to repeat this same sleep routine tonight, and maybe even go to bed a little earlier. The goal here is to be tired an hour or two into the flight so I can sleep the rest of the way. I will then, assuming all goes as planned, continue to ease back into my normal sleep routine on GMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next goal of mine is to take more video, and this means two separate things. I want to not only work on my video skills as a photographer, but in the spirit of documenting more, I want to get more video of everyday things happening, and me doing things as simple as spending time with my family. I am not sure about doing “vlog” style videos, as I am not particularly comfortable in front of the camera, however I will certainly be using my GoPro for significant amounts of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I want to continue to stay healthy on this trip, and get back into my workouts. This should be pretty easy to do, knock on wood…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are my goals, but how else am I prepping for this trip?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, in the spirit of documenting things, I wanted to have access to mobile data while on this trip. I did some research, and Google’s Project Fi was the perfect option. The price breakdown is pretty straightforward. $20 for unlimited texting internationally (with varying rate of calls outside of North America), and $10 dollars for every gig of data up to 6 gigs. After the 6th gig, you get unlimited data, but it is throttled to a whopping 256k… If you want, you can enable speedy data again with the same price per gig coming back as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also needed to pack all of my SD cards. These are all of them, plus a 128GB card currently in my camera, and another 32GB card in my GoPro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that is all for now :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So in just over four days I am heading to Europe for an incredible trip with my mom. It is something that I have been looking forward to for a while, and is definitely a place that is conducive to taking lots and lots of photos. I am looking to also try out my new GoPro Hero 7 Black while I’m there and throughout the trip in general as well - we shall see how that goes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured this website would be a sufficient outlet for me to document and share, which is something I wanna try and do more in my life. I don’t really have a great central place to do this right now, and with a website I have the control that I want to do it my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now :)&lt;/p&gt;
