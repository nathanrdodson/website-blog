    <h1 class="article title">Trip Preparation</h1><p class="article date">Tuesday, July 30, 2019 at 11:32AM -05:00</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>For my trip to Europe, my preparation has been significantly more intensive than what would be considered “normal” on previous trips I’ve had. This is mainly because I have set a few goals for myself, some small, and some much larger.</p>
<p>For starters, I want to beat the jet lag - at least on my flight to Manchester. Our current itinerary has us leaving Atlanta at 6:00PM and arriving in Manchester just before 7:00AM. This means that I will need to sleep the entire flight to have energy for the day in Manchester. In order to achieve this, I have started to do a few things: one, I went to bed at around 9:00PM Monday night and woke up at around 3:00AM the next morning (the morning I am writing this :)</p>
<p>The next step is to repeat this same sleep routine tonight, and maybe even go to bed a little earlier. The goal here is to be tired an hour or two into the flight so I can sleep the rest of the way. I will then, assuming all goes as planned, continue to ease back into my normal sleep routine on GMT.</p>
<p>The next goal of mine is to take more video, and this means two separate things. I want to not only work on my video skills as a photographer, but in the spirit of documenting more, I want to get more video of everyday things happening, and me doing things as simple as spending time with my family. I am not sure about doing “vlog” style videos, as I am not particularly comfortable in front of the camera, however I will certainly be using my GoPro for significant amounts of footage.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to continue to stay healthy on this trip, and get back into my workouts. This should be pretty easy to do, knock on wood…</p>
<p>So those are my goals, but how else am I prepping for this trip?</p>
<p>Once again, in the spirit of documenting things, I wanted to have access to mobile data while on this trip. I did some research, and Google’s Project Fi was the perfect option. The price breakdown is pretty straightforward. $20 for unlimited texting internationally (with varying rate of calls outside of North America), and $10 dollars for every gig of data up to 6 gigs. After the 6th gig, you get unlimited data, but it is throttled to a whopping 256k… If you want, you can enable speedy data again with the same price per gig coming back as well.</p>
<p>Of course, I also needed to pack all of my SD cards. These are all of them, plus a 128GB card currently in my camera, and another 32GB card in my GoPro.</p>
<p>Anyways, that is all for now :)</p>
